        des:"AGIB GameFi AGIB iNFTs are inherent generative and interactive, making themselves capable of being simulational, playful, and of real-time. These traits stand at the heart not merely of AGIB GameFi, but of prerequisites entering the Metaverse. For now, we will serve two games that let our holders can entertain with their own iNFTs. 3️⃣ Customization Play Through our website, you can have fun with your AGIBs (Avatar NFT and Voice NFT). Via AI stylish techniques, your AGIBs can be transformed, blended, or even re-created with your own picture or/and voice to be any possibility. Such derivative creation makes your AGIBs more exclusive and eye-catching. 4️⃣ Costume Play Aside from total transformation, AGIB holders can participate in the exclusive costume play. In this game, you can dress up your AGIBs. What we are excited to see is how this will have an impact on rarity. Your creativity will be tested. Our goal for this game is to bring wearable fashion inside the Metaverse.",

        des: "AGIB-verse AGIB NFT is not an insular Frankenstein but tends to engage in your life, from linking to the environment, people, and society. AGIB will build its own world, blurring the boundary delineated between the physical world and the Metaverse. Augmented Reality - Linking to Environment Augmented Reality (AR) makes all AGIB live virtually around you. Specifically, AGIB holders will be able to interact with their AGIB in AR through Instagram, TikTok, or our app on their mobile devices. You will have a multidimensional experience with your AGIB whenever and wherever. Merchandise - Linking to Others AGIB has a very exciting plan for actual AGIB Merch, available exclusively to AGIB holders. AGIB holders can utilize their NFTs to create varying products from plushies and clothing. This is a great opportunity for holders to make profits and represent the project IRL with pride. AGIB holders will enjoy full intellectual property rights to their NFTs to use or remix them in any way they want. DAO and AGIB coin - Linking to Community AGIB love to live in a healthy community where everyone has a say. For that reason, we use a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to make decisions crucial to the development of the community. Each holder's vote is equally important to the growth and evolution of the community. Moreover, we will mint and distribute AGIB coins for staking and profit-sharing. Collaborations - Linking to Society Collaborations are also underway with various project groups, anime artists, celebs, and the high-tech industry. We are carrying out at least over 10+ collaborations distributed in the English and Chinese world.",
